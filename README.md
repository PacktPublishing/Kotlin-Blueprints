# Kotlin Blueprints
This is the code repository for [Kotlin Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kotlin-blueprints?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788390804), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Kotlin is a powerful language that has applications in a wide variety of fields. It is a concise, safe, interoperable, and tool-friendly language. The Android team has also announced first-class support for Kotlin, which is an added boost to the language. Kotlin’s growth is fueled through carefully designed business and technology benefits.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 01 has no codes, rest all the chapters have codes present in their respective folders

The code will look like the following:
```
    var createTweet: Button? = null
    createTweet.setOnClickListener({
      // Do button click operation
    })
```

You will need to have the following:
1. JDK8 (download it from http:/​/​www.​oracle.​com/​technetwork/​java/​javase/
downloads/​jdk8-​downloads-​2133151.​html)
2. An IDE with the Kotlin plugin—you can use Eclipse (http:/​/​www.​eclipse.​org)
and install the Kotlin plugin, or IntelliJ idea (https:/​/​www.​jetbrains.​com/​idea/
download/​). The latter is more popular in the Kotlin community and is used in
most of the chapters. The community edition is enough for most of the chapters,
unless specified otherwise in the chapter.
3. Additional plugins may be needed to be installed into the IDE as specified in the
respective chapter.
